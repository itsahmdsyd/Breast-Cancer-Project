# Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project is part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**, a scholarship provided by the **Ministry of Information Technology and Communication**. Under the guidance of our instructor, Ahmed Moustafa, our team—**Ahmed Elsayed, Ammar Osama, Moustafa Alaa, and Mahmoud Mohamed Helmy**—aims to develop a comprehensive analysis and prediction model for breast cancer prognosis.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to utilize **data science methodologies**, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, to predict patient outcomes based on clinical features. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to:
- Uncover critical factors influencing prognosis and survival
- Develop a predictive model to forecast survival chances

## Dataset

| **T Stage**                 | Tumor stage (e.g., T1, T2), indicating the size and extent of the primary tumor               |
| **N Stage**                 | Node stage (e.g., N1, N2), reflecting the extent of lymph node involvement                    |
| **6th Stage**               | Breast cancer stage classification based on the 6th edition TNM staging system (e.g., IIA)    |
| **Differentiation**         | Describes how much tumor cells resemble normal cells (e.g., Poorly differentiated)            |
| **Grade**                   | A numerical value (e.g., 1-3) indicating tumor aggressiveness                                 |
| **A Stage**                 | Additional stage data related to the spread of cancer in the body                             |
| **Tumor Size**              | Size of the tumor in millimeters                                                              |
| **Estrogen Status**         | Indicates if the tumor is estrogen-receptor-positive or negative (ER status)                  |
| **Progesterone Status**     | Indicates if the tumor is progesterone-receptor-positive or negative (PR status)              |
| **Regional Nodes Examined** | Number of regional lymph nodes examined during surgery                                        |
| **Regional Node Positive**  | Number of lymph nodes with cancer present                                                     |
| **Survival Months**         | Number of months the patient has survived since diagnosis                                     |
| **Status**                  | The patient's current status (Alive or Dead)                                                  |

## Project Scope

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Understand the dataset, visualize the distributions, and analyze the relationships between variables.
- **Methods**: Utilize statistical analysis to identify key factors impacting breast cancer prognosis.

### 2. Machine Learning (ML)
- **Objective**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict patient survival and outcomes.
- **Approach**:
  - Test multiple classification algorithms to predict outcomes accurately.
  - Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize prediction accuracy.

By leveraging historical patient data, this project aims to demonstrate the practical application of predictive analytics in healthcare. We hope to contribute to the early detection of high-risk patients and potentially assist in optimizing treatment strategies.
